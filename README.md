## Skroutz Center Integration

To use your Skroutz endpoint as a data source in Skroutz Center:

1. **Deploy your endpoint**
  Ensure your authentication and data endpoints are publicly accessible and return the required data format (e.g., XML, CSV, or JSON).
  For this extension, your endpoint will typically be:
  `https://yoursite.com/skroutz/products.xml`

2. **Copy your endpoint URL**
  This is the URL that Skroutz Center will fetch data from.

3. **Add as a data feed in Skroutz Center**
   - Go to [Skroutz Merchants](https://merchants.skroutz.gr/).
   - In the header, click **Settings & tools**.
   - Select **Data sources**.
   - Click **Add product source**.
   - Choose **Add products from a file**.
   - Enter your endpoint URL (e.g., `https://yoursite.com/skroutz/products.xml`) as the feed source.
   - Set fetch frequency and credentials if authentication is required.

4. **Test and verify**
  After saving, Google will attempt to fetch your data. Check for errors and ensure your feed is processed correctly.
